TinyIDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TinyIDS is a distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Unix systems.
It is based on client/server architecture. The client, tinyids, runs its
hashing backends on the local system and calculates a hash of the file
contents and their metadata. It then compares this hash with one that has
been previously stored on the server counterpart of TinyIDS, tinyidsd,
which runs on a remote system. Management of the remotely stored hash is
possible through the client's command line interface. Communication between
the client and the server counterparts can be encrypted using RSA public
key infrastructure (PKI).

TinyIDS is written in Python and is released as open-source software under
the terms of the Apache license version 2.
