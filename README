TinyIDS
------------------------------------------------------------------------

TinyIDS is a distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for Unix systems.
It is based on a client-server architecture. The client (tinyids) runs its
testing backends on the local system and calculates a hash of the file
contents and their metadata. It then compares this hash with one that has
been previously stored on a remote tinyidsd server. Management of the
remotely stored hash is possible through the client's command line interface.
Supports encrypted client-server communication using PKI.

TinyIDS is written in Python and is open-source software.
