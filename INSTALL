TinyIDS Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
------------
In order to run TinyIDS you will need:

 - Python (http://python.org/)


Installation
------------
TinyIDS can be installed either directly from source code or from a package,
for instance an RPM or DEB package, that has been specifically prepared for
your operating system.

The following procedure describes how to install the TinyIDS release from
source code on a POSIX-compatible operating system.

* Download and extract the source-code distribution package of TinyIDS:

  wget http://www.codetrax.org/attachments/download/XX/tinyids-X.X.X.tar.gz
  tar -xzvf tinyids-X.X.X.tar.gz
  cd tinyids-X.X.X

* Run the installer:

  python setup.py install -f

TinyIDS is now installed on your system.

* Prepare the system to run a TinyIDS Server

Before running a TinyIDS server, it is necessary to accomplish some extra
system administration tasks:

1. Create a user to run tinyidsd

It is highly recommended that you create an unprivileged system user which will
be used to run the server process.

  groupadd -r tinyids
  useradd -r -g tinyids tinyids

2. Set filesystem permissions

The TinyIDS server stores the client information in a database. The default
location, where this database is stored is /var/lib/tinyids/tinyids.db
This means that the tinyidsd server process needs to have write permission
to the /var/lib/tinyids/ directory. Proper permissions can be set by invoking
the following commands:

  chmod 0750 /var/lib/tinyids
  chown tinyids /var/lib/tinyids
  chgrp tinyids /var/lib/tinyids
